# 📊 Event-Driven Serverless ETL Pipeline on AWS



### 📌 Project Level: Intermediate
A hands-on AWS data engineering project demonstrating how to design and implement an automated, event-driven ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using fully managed, serverless AWS services.

---

### 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a scalable and reliable ETL pipeline where data processing is triggered automatically by events rather than manual execution or scheduled jobs.

• CSV files uploaded to Amazon S3 are detected in real time  
• Data transformation is handled using AWS Glue  
• Processed output is written back to Amazon S3  
• Amazon EventBridge monitors storage and job execution events  
• Amazon SNS delivers email notifications  
• AWS CloudWatch provides centralized logging and monitoring  

The architecture emphasizes automation, reliability, observability, and minimal operational overhead.

### 🎯 Objective

• Design a fully serverless, event-driven ETL pipeline on AWS  
• Automatically process data upon file upload  
• Eliminate server and cluster management  
• Enable real-time notifications and monitoring  
• Demonstrate production-style data engineering patterns

###  🧰 AWS Services Used

| AWS Service        | Purpose                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon S3          | Stores raw input and transformed output data               |
| AWS Lambda         | Triggers ETL workflows based on S3 events                  |
| AWS Glue           | Performs data extraction, transformation, and loading      |
| Amazon EventBridge | Captures and routes S3 and Glue job events                 |
| Amazon SNS         | Sends email notifications for pipeline events              |
| Amazon CloudWatch  | Centralized logging, monitoring, and auditing              |
| AWS IAM            | Manages secure, role-based access control                  |

### 📂 S3 Data Layout

| S3 Path                    | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| etl-pipeline-bucket/       | Root S3 bucket for the ETL pipeline              |
| etl-pipeline-bucket/extract/ | Stores raw CSV input files uploaded by users     |
| etl-pipeline-bucket/load/    | Stores transformed output files generated by Glue |

###  🔄 Workflow Overview

• Upload CSV file to S3 `extract/` folder  
• Amazon S3 generates an object creation event  
• AWS Lambda function is triggered automatically  
• Lambda starts the AWS Glue ETL job  
• AWS Glue processes and transforms the data  
• Transformed data is written to S3 `load/` folder  
• Glue job state change event is generated  
• Amazon EventBridge routes the event  
• Amazon SNS sends notification emails  
• AWS CloudWatch records logs and metrics  

---

###  🚀 Key Features

• Fully automated ETL pipeline  
• Event-driven execution model  
• Serverless architecture with zero infrastructure management  
• Near real-time data processing  
• Visual ETL job design using AWS Glue  
• Email notifications for data and job events  
• Centralized logging and monitoring  
• Scalable and cost-efficient solution  

---

###  ⚙️ Architecture Highlights

• Uses Amazon S3 events instead of polling mechanisms  
• Separates orchestration logic (Lambda) from transformation logic (Glue)  
• Leverages EventBridge for reliable event routing  
• Supports multiple event targets such as SNS and CloudWatch  
• Designed for extensibility and production workloads  

---

### 🏁 Outcome

• Hands-on experience with serverless ETL pipelines  
• Strong understanding of event-driven data processing on AWS  
• Practical exposure to AWS Glue, EventBridge, and Lambda integration  
• Improved knowledge of observability and monitoring  
• Foundation for building production-ready data engineering solutions
